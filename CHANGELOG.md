# Changelog

**Languages:** English only, same reasoning as `docs/ROADMAP.md` -- this is a working/historical log, not
a stable specification.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning follows
[SemVer](https://semver.org/), with this policy while the project stays pre-1.0 (`0.MINOR.PATCH`):

- **MINOR** bump: anything a user can newly do -- a new module, a new API route, a new frontend section.
  Also any breaking change (SemVer allows those in a MINOR before 1.0), called out with a `⚠ Breaking`
  bullet so it is never missed just because the version number alone did not say so.
- **PATCH** bump: bug fixes, internal refactors, tests, docs, UI rewording/reorganizing that adds no new
  capability.
- **1.0.0**: reserved for the Phase 8 gate in `docs/ROADMAP.md` ("the project is in a condition to be
  called beta 0.9") -- not claimed before that milestone is actually reached.
- Every tag stays available forever (nothing gets deleted); "stable" means it also has a non-prerelease
  GitHub Release. Given this project already verifies live against a real backend before every commit
  (see git log), most tags qualify by default -- a tag only gets marked as a GitHub pre-release when it is
  explicitly experimental (e.g. something tied to `wifi-interno-virtwifi` as a default, or a deliberately
  unfinished checkpoint).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-24

First tagged release. Covers Phases 0-5 of `docs/ROADMAP.md` plus everything built on top of them since.

### Added

- Instance lifecycle (create/start/stop/restart/delete) against real `redroid` containers, with a Doctor
  diagnostics page for host prerequisites (binder/binderfs, loop, ext4) and per-image support tiers
  (official/community, `backend/images.json`).
- Hardware acceleration: `hwenc` (VA-API encode, AMD/Intel) and `hwdec` (VA-API/NVDEC decode), GPU mode
  selection (host/guest) per instance, a VA-API daemon supervisor, bitrate control and P-frame support.
- Fake WiFi (`wifi-interno`, hwsim-backed) and device profile spoofing (`backend/src/lib/deviceProfile.js`
  -- a Samsung Galaxy A55 profile, revert to the `redroid` default), both applicable live while the
  instance is running or staged for the next start while stopped.
- A generic per-module contract system: manifest schema, a contract modal (`frontend/contracts.js`), and
  a persisted acceptance record -- gates any module that is not 100% free software (GApps, ARM
  translation) or needs explicit host compatibility (`compatibleCon`: Android version, GPU mode, host GPU
  vendor) before it can be activated.
- A read-only known-combinations database (`backend/src/lib/knownDb.js`) resolving a "soporte" verdict
  (official/community/unsupported) per instance, synced from a signed (ed25519) external snapshot.
- User-defined modules (stage 7): a generic runner for per-game/situation automations with their own
  pause/resume/status and persistent scheduling, with CIFI as the first real one.
- Instance backup/restore: whole-`/data`-volume tar.gz backups (not gated to the instance that made
  them -- restoring onto a different/migrated instance is supported), with a metadata sidecar that warns
  (never blocks) on image/module mismatches, and an opt-in Android ID/GSF identity reset on restore.
- Settings (default backup folder) and per-instance real storage location (Docker volume + host
  mountpoint), surfaced in the frontend.
- Instances table redesign: two rows per instance (a big "just let me connect" line, a detail/actions
  line) instead of one row of columns; CPU/RAM live editing and resolution/GPU/codec/WiFi/device-
  profile/optional-modules editing split into two panels by whether applying them interrupts the
  instance.
- `scrcpy` connector scripts (`connect.sh`/`connect.ps1`) and a troubleshooting/shortcuts guide
  (`docs/SCRCPY-TIPS.md`).
